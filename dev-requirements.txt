# Pip requirements file for development dependencies.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# Make sure that the package versions in minimum-constraints.txt are also
# the minimum versions required in requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt.


# Runtime dependencies:
-r requirements.txt


# Direct dependencies:

# Tests (imports into testcases):
pytest>=3.0.5 # MIT
# mock>=2.0.0 # BSD
# requests-mock>=1.2.0 # Apache-2.0
# testfixtures>=4.13.3 # Apache-2.0
# yamlordereddictloader>=0.4.0

# Tests (no imports, invoked via py.test script):

# TODO: Remove the pinning of the pytest-cov version again once issue
#       https://github.com/z4r/python-coveralls/issues/66
#       is resolved.
#       Background: pytest-cov 2.6.0 has increased the version
#       requirement for the coverage package from >=3.7.1 to
#       >=4.4, which is in conflict with the version requirement
#       defined by the python-coveralls package for coverage==4.0.3.
pytest-cov>=2.4.0,<2.6 # BSD

# Coverage reporting (no imports, invoked via coveralls script):
python-coveralls>=2.9.0 # Apache-2.0

# Sphinx (no imports, invoked via sphinx-build script):
Sphinx>=1.7.6,<2.0.0; python_version < '3.5'  # BSD
Sphinx>=1.7.6,<2.0.0; python_version >= '3.5'  # BSD
# TODO: On py3.5+, Sphinx currently fails, see issue
#       https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6246. Therefore, Sphinx has
#       been pinned to below 2.0.0 also for py3.5+.
sphinx-git>=10.1.1 # GPL
GitPython>=2.1.1 # BSD

# PyLint (no imports, invoked via pylint script):
pylint>=1.6.4; python_version == '2.7'

# Flake8 (no imports, invoked via flake8 script):
flake8>=3.7.0 # MIT
# Note: Flake8 requires pyflakes>=2.1.0 and pycodestyle>=2.5.0, but for reasons
#       not understood, the resulting installation has pycodestyle 2.2.0,
#       causing issues. Workaround is to specify these dependencies here.
pyflakes>=2.1.0 # MIT
pycodestyle>=2.5.0 # MIT

# Twine (no imports, invoked via twine script):
twine>=1.8.1 # Apache-2.0
