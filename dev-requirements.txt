# Pip requirements file for development dependencies.
#
# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# Make sure that the package versions in minimum-constraints.txt are also
# the minimum versions required in requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt.

# Tests (no imports, invoked via py.test script):

# TODO: Remove the pinning of the pytest-cov version again once issue
#       https://github.com/z4r/python-coveralls/issues/66
#       is resolved.
#       Background: pytest-cov 2.6.0 has increased the version
#       requirement for the coverage package from >=3.7.1 to
#       >=4.4, which is in conflict with the version requirement
#       defined by the python-coveralls package for coverage==4.0.3.
pytest-cov>=2.4.0,<2.6 # BSD

# Coverage reporting (no imports, invoked via coveralls script):
python-coveralls>=2.9.0 # Apache-2.0

# TODO: On py3.5+, Sphinx currently fails, see issue
#       https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6246. Therefore, Sphinx has
#       been pinned to below 2.0.0 also for py3.5+.
sphinx-git>=10.1.1 # GPL

# PyLint (no imports, invoked via pylint script)
# Pylint is not run on py27 anymore
# Pylint requires astroid
# Pylint 1.x / astroid 1.x supports py27 and py34/35/36
# Pylint 2.0 / astroid 2.0 removed py27, added py37
# Pylint 2.4 / astroid 2.3 removed py34
# Issue #2673: Pinning Pylint to <2.7.0 is a circumvention for Pylint issue
#   https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4120 that appears in Pylint 2.7.0.
#   Pylint 2.10 has fixed the issue.
