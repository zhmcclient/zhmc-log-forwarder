# Generally package vulnerabilites listed in the ignore-vulnerabilities
# list below are there because:
# 1. There is no release that resolves the vulnerability.  In this case, there
#    should also be an expire entry to remind the pywbem team to recheck
# 2. The required version of a package to resolve the issue is not available
#    for all of the python version supported by pywbem. In that case, the
#    vulnerability will remain ignored until such time as the versions of
#    python that cannot support the required version of the package are no
#    longer supported by pywbem.

    # - 4: ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL, HIGH & MEDIUM severity
