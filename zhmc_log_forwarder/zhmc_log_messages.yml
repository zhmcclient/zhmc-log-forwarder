# zhmc_log_forwarder HMC log message file
#
# This file defines information about HMC log messages that allows translating
# an HMC log message received from the HMC into a CADF event.
#
# For a list of the possible HMC log messages, see the Help system of a real
# HMC, in section "Introduction" -> "Audit, Event, and Security Log Messages".
#
# For the CADF standard DSP0262, see
# https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0262_1.0.0.pdf
#
# The data specified for each HMC log message in this file, is:
# * number (string): event-id / number of HMC log message.
# * message (string): message template of HMC log message.
# * action (string): CADF action. See DSP0262 "CADF Action Taxonomy".
# * outcome (string): CADF outcome. See DSP0262 "CADF Outcome Taxonomy".
# * target_type (string): CADF typeURI of target resource. See DSP0262
#   A.2 "CADF Resource Taxonomy".
# * target_class (string): HMC resource class of target resource. See HMS WS
#   API book, 'class' property of the data models. Example: 'partition'.
#
# See zhmc_log_forwarder --help-log-message-file for details.

# HMC version to which this HMC log message file applies
