Version 1.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2024-10-10

**Bug fixes:**

* Addressed safety issues up to 2024-08-18.

* Test: Fixed coveralls not found on MacOS with Python 3.9-3.11.

* Test: Resolved new issues reported by Pylint 3.3.

* Dev: Fixed checks and missing removal of temp file in make targets for releasing
  and starting a version.

* Dev: In the make commands to create/update AUTHORS.md, added a reftag to the
  'git shortlog' command to fix the issue that without a terminal (e.g. in GitHub
  Actions), the command did not display any authors.

* Fixed incorrect check for start branch in 'make start_tag'. (`#88 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/88>`_)

**Enhancements:**

* Changed 'make install' to install in non-editable mode.

* Dev: Relaxed the conditions when safety issues are tolerated.

* Dev: The AUTHORS.md file is now updated when building the distribution
  archives.

* Migrated to pyproject.toml. (`#48 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/48>`_)

* Added support for running the 'ruff' checker via "make ruff" and added that
  to the test workflow. (`#58 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/58>`_)

* Added support for running the 'bandit' checker with a new make target
  'bandit', and added that to the GitHub Actions test workflow.
  Adjusted the code in order to pass the bandit check. (`#59 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/59>`_)

* Support for and test of Python 3.13.0-rc.1. Needed to increase the minimum
  versions of PyYAML to 6.0.2. (`#62 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/62>`_)

* Test: Added tests for Python 3.13 (final version). (`#63 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/63>`_)

* Dev: Encapsulated the starting of a new version into new 'start_branch' and
  'start_tag' make targets. See the development documentation for details. (`#70 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/70>`_)

* Dev: Encapsulated the releasing of a version to PyPI into new 'release_branch'
  and 'release_publish' make targets. See the development documentation for
  details. (`#70 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/70>`_)

* Added support for building a Docker container that runs the log forwarder. (`#81 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/81>`_)

* Increased zhmcclient to 1.18.0 to pick up fixes. (`#85 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/85>`_)

**Cleanup:**

* Dev: Dropped the 'make upload' target, because the release to PyPI has
  been migrated to using a publish workflow. (`#70 <https://github.com/zhmcclient/zhmc-log-forwarder/issues/70>`_)
